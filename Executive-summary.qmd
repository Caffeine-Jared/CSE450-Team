## Background

_A major telemarketing campaign and the results were inadequete to come to a conclusion. We were assigned to impelment a Machine Learning Algorithim to help find the following:_

_1. Find interesting customer segments based on their previous marketing campaign._
_2. Find a way to identify the types of customers most likely to respond favorably to future marketing campaigns._
_3.Proving to a skeptical Senhor Ferreira that a targeted campaign based on data science will significantly outperform a campaign made up of randomly selected customers._

_Since we're operating in the European Union, we're subject to GDPR compliance requirements. The GDPR doesn't apply in this situation, since we're just building a model, not selling data. In order to use this data under GDPR, we'll need to get consent from the customers in the dataset. We are also using only historic data that has been put into an anonymous format so we will be complaint in that department as well._
